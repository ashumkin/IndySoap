		<H2>Troubleshooting
		</H2>
		<P>So many things can wrong with Soap that it can be difficult to know where to 
			start.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<H4>Pascal -&gt; ITI conversion</H4>
		<P>The pascal -&gt; ITI conversion process is pretty reliable. Generally, if you 
			get an error in this process, you've attempted to do something that indysoap 
			cannot support.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<H4>WSDL -&gt; Pascal conversion</H4>
		<P>If the problem concerns the WSDL to Pascal conversion process failing, there's 
			almost certainly something in the WSDL that IndySoap does not support. You can 
			forward the (whole) WSDL to the IndySoap team in a bug report for 
			consideration. But there's many things that WSDL's declare that cannot be 
			supported through IndySoap, so it may not be accepted as a bug</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<H4>Run time SOAP problems</H4>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>In general, if you want to submit a bug report to the IndySoap team, you will 
			need to assemble some resources. Often, the process of assembling these 
			resources will help you solve the problem. But there's several things to check 
			before you do:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Is the ITI current?
			<LI>
			Are all your implementation methods published?
			<LI>
			Are all the types registered?
			<LI>
			Does your implementation object descend from TIdBaseSoapImplementation
			<LI>
			If the interface source wasn't generated by the IndySoap WSDL -&gt; Pascal 
			convertor, check the interface source carefully. Also check that the 
			appropriate SOAP Metadata has been added to the interface declaration
			<LI>
				check the properties of the soap components.</LI></UL>
		<P>If you want to report a bug to IndySoap, you generally need to submit the 
			following things:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			the WSDL for the server
			<LI>
			the interface source
			<LI>
				a packet trace for both request and response<BR>
				The easiest way to generate a packet trace is to use proxyTrace or tcpTrace. 
				Both are available from <A href="http://www.pocketsoap.com">http://www.pocketsoap.com</A>
			<LI>
				a detailed description of the problem
			</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>Report all bugs to the <A href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/indy-soap-public/">IndySoap 
				mailing List</A>. If there is some reason why you are not happy to attach 
			these resources to the bug report, you can indicate that you are prepared to 
			supply them on request to an IndySoap team member when they are working on your 
			bug.</P>
