<p>The TIdSoapDouble type declares aTIdBaseSoapableClass descendent
that exposes a double. This class exists to allow soap consumers to be
informed of the difference between a double with value 0, and a double
where the xml atttribute nil="true" is defined.<br>
</p>
<p>The WSDL importer will use this type where the WSDL declares that a
type is nillable. You can interchange between double and TIdSoapDouble
in the interface declaration.<br>
