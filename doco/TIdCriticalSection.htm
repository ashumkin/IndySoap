		<P>TIdSoapCriticalSection is a descendent of the normal criticalsection. It adds 
			one important property, LockedToMe (:boolean). This can be used to check the 
			the lock is already locked in the thread. This is used in IndySoap for 
			pre-condition testing</P>
		<P><EM>(You might think that it would be good enough simply to lock the lock, but as 
				well as having performance impacts, some times the locking issues cannot be 
				resolved in the context of the routine that requires the lock. If you are doing 
				concurrent programming, you really should use TIdSoapCriticalSection.LockedToMe 
				a lot)</EM></P>
