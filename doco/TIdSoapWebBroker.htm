		<P>
			TIdSoapWebBroker implements a Web Broker component for IndySoap, suitable for 
			use on WebModules.</P>
		<P>To use the IndySoap WebBroker Server, drop it on a WebModule. You need to set 2 
			sets of properties:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				Standard IndySoap properties. Consult <A href="TIdSoapServer.htm">TIdSoapServer</A>&nbsp;for 
			further information.
			<LI>
				WebDispatch Path. You wouldn't normally need to set this as the default value 
				soap* is usually appropriate</LI></UL>
		<P>Generally, you also need a <A href="TIdSoapWebBrokerWSDL.htm">TIdSoapWebBrokerWSDL </A>
			to publish the WSDL for the service
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>You can have multiple different Servers on different paths, each publishing a 
			different set of SOAP services.</P>
