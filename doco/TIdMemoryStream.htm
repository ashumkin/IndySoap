TIdMemoryStream is a descendent of TMemoryStream. The only new functionality it introduces is to register itself with the IndySoap Live Object tracking layer.
<p>
Whereever IndySoap interfaces create TStream objects, what is actually created is a TIdMemoryStream. Refer to <a href="Intf_Classes.htm">Classes in Interfaces</a> for further information about object lifetime management
<p>
If the IndySoap leak notification that appears when your program closes lists any TIdMemoryStream objects still live, then you probably have a TStream object you have forgotton to Free.
