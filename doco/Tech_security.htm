		IndySoap provides a path from incoming network traffic to a procedural 
		invocation engine. IndySoap aims to provide security that assures that a valid 
		request with a valid set of parameters that is addressed to a properly defined 
		interface will be delivered to that interface in code with all parameters being 
		valid object pascal types. Any other circumstances will result in a transport 
		layer error or a SOAP fault returned to the client
		<p>
		IndySoap does not use static buffers, and is not subject to buffer overruns. 
		Underlying Indy Code (or other transport layers that may be defined) may use 
		static buffers, IndySoap makes no promises about this
		<p>
		In general, this security goal translates to assurance that IndySoap works as 
		expected.
		<p>
		Security flaws in IndySoap should be reported on the Yahoogroups.com group 
		Indy-Soap-Public. Genuine security issues will be dealt with as the first 
		priority by the IndySoap team
		<p>
			<H4>Communications Security</H4>
		IndySoap does not provide any of this. It’s up to the application to configure 
		the network traffic accordingly.
		<p>
			<H4>Application Security</H4>
		<P>IndySoap publishes information about the Soap request that led to the interface 
			being called. The unit IdSoapRequestInfo publishes a thread local variable 
			called GIdSoapRequestInfo which will contain a transport layer specific 
			descendent of TIdSoapRequestInformation that will make as much information as 
			possible about the request available to the client. If the interface is not 
			invoked by IndySoap, then GIdSoapRequestInfo will be nil
		</P>
		<P>In addition, IndySoap provides support for an application session. IndySoap can 
			be asked to enfore that a valid session exists before allowing access (on the 
			server). For further information about sessions, see <A href="SessionManagement.htm">
