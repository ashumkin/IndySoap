		<H2>TIdSoapServerHTTP</H2>
		<P>TIdSoapServerHTTP is the server side implementation of the SOAP/HTTP transport 
			mapping. TIdSoapServerHTTP will take HTTP Calls and redirect the calls to the 
			assigned TIdSoapServer. TIdSoapServerHTTP is a descendent of 
			TIdCustomHTTPServer, and provides all the behaviours expected of TIdHTTPServer, 
			except for OnGetCommand, so that you can run other web services through the 
			same port.
		</P>
		<P>This documentation describes the features introduced to support SOAP HTTP 
			service.

		<H4>Properties</H4>
		<PRE>&nbsp; property SOAPServer : TIdSoapServer;</PRE>
		<P>The TIdSoapServer that provides the actual SOAP services. You must assign a 
			valid TIdSoapServer to this property for SOAP to work
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<PRE>&nbsp; property SOAPPath&nbsp;: string;</PRE>
		<P>This is the path where soap services are found. Usually this is /SOAP/ but can 
			be any other value. Any calls made to the path /SOAP/xxx will be redirected to 
			the SOAPServer</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<PRE>&nbsp; property WSDLPath : string; </PRE>
		<P>Path where WSDL's describing SOAP services provided can be found Description: 
			Usually this is /wsdl
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<PRE>type<BR>  TIdSOAPPreExecuteEvent = procedure(AThread: TIdPeerThread; ARequestInfo: TIdHTTPRequestInfo; AResponseInfo: TIdHTTPResponseInfo; var VHandled: Boolean) of object;<BR>&nbsp; property OnPreExecute : TIdSOAPPreExecuteEvent;</PRE>
		<P>This event is called for every incoming HTTP request. The application can use 
			this to prescreen HTTP calls and handle them before they reach the SOAP 
			service. This is an ideal place to implement security if desired. If the Event 
			parameter VHandled is set to true, then the server will do nothing more with 
			the request. Other than this, the parameters are the same as for the 
			TIdCustomHTTPServer.OnGetCommand</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<PRE>&nbsp; property OnNonSoapExecute : TIdHTTPGetEvent;</PRE>
		<P>Event called when a non-SOAP/non-WSDL request is received from a client (based 
			on Path matching). Description: This Event has the same parameters and function 
			as TIdCustomHTTPServer.OnGetCommand. If this event is not found, the server 
			will return "404 Access Denied"</P>
