		<P>TIdSoapClientHTTP provides an implementation of the classic SOAP/HTTP mapping. 
			To use the SOAP/HTTP protocol, simply define the SoapURL property. If you need 
			more advanced control over the HTTP request, create your own Indy HTTP client 
			(TIdHTTP), configure it how you want, and set the HTTPClient to point to your 
			TIdHTTP instance.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<PRE>&nbsp; property SoapURL : string;</PRE>
		<P>HTTP URL for the soap server
		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<PRE>&nbsp; property HTTPClient : TIdHTTP;</PRE>
		<P>You may need to configure the client specially. Usually this is in regard to 
			timeout, proxy settings, etc. You do this by creating a TidHTTP client, 
			configuring it how you want, and assigning it to this property
