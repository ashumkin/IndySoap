			TIdSoapInterfaceGlue</H2>
		<P>An instance of TIdSoapInterfaceGlue is generated everytime a new IndySoap 
			interface is created. The interface reference&nbsp;counting actually applies to 
			the TIdSoapInterfaceGlue instance. The glue maintains a link to it's 
			TIdSoapSender which will be broken if the TIdSoapSender is freed before the 
			interface goes out of scope</P>
		<P>There is no circumstance under which you should (or could) use a 
			TIdSoapInterfaceGlue object directly. The primary cause for documenting this is 
			that you may get an IndySoap leak report concerning this. If you do, there is 
			some interface reference counting problem, and the interface is never being 
			freed.</P>
