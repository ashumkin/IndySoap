		If the server raises an exception, this will be returned to the client as a 
		SOAP fault. The common RTL, Indy and OpenXML exceptions are automatically 
		transferred across and their class is maintained. If you raise one of your own 
		exceptions on the server, it will be raised as a EIdUnknownRemoteException on 
		the client by remote. If you want the class of the exception raised on the 
		client to be right, define the exception as a descendent of 
		EIdBaseSoapableException, and register it on the client using the 
		IdSoapTypeRegistry procedure IdRegisterException.
