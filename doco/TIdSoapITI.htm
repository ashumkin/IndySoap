		<P>TIdSoapITI is the base class for an ITI structure. The ITI stores all the 
			metadata associated with the interfaces in use by IndySoap.

		<P>You should not use a TIdSoapITI directly. You may see an IndySoap leak 
			notification concerning TIdSoapITI - if this is so then either a client or 
			server has not been cleaned up</P>
