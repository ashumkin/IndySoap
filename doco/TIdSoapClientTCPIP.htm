		Unit: IdSoapClientHTTP
		<P>
		Provides a SOAP mapping to a custom IndySoap direct TCP/IP communication 
		protocol for use with SOAP request/response. The major advantage of this 
		protocol is that a connection is held open, and the protocol is extremely light 
		weight. This makes this protocol suitable for use in a LAN environment with 
		tightly bound client/server environment.
		<P>
		The connection is opened and closed as the component active property is changed
		<P>&nbsp;<PRE>  property SoapHost&nbsp;: string;</PRE>
		<P>
		Network address or name of SOAP Server
		<P>&nbsp;<PRE>&nbsp; property SoapPort : word; </PRE>
		<P>
		Listening Port of SOAP Service
		<P>&nbsp;<PRE>  property SoapTimeout : integer;</PRE>
		<P>
		How long to wait before giving up on the server
		<P>&nbsp;<PRE>&nbsp;property TCPClient : TIdTCPClient; </PRE>
		<P>Summary: Ignore SOAPHost and SOAPPort, and use the assigned TCPClient instead.
