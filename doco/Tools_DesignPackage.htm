The IndySoap design package registers the 
IndySoap components.
<p>
In addition, whenever a project is compiled,
the IndySoap Design time package will 
check to see if a file with the same name
as the project, but a .IdSoapCfg extension
exists.
<p>
If it does exist, it will execute the file 
before the project is built
