<OL>
			<li>
			You need the latest Indy release (9.011 or more recent)
			<li>
				You need the latest DUnit source to run the DUnit tests (from <a href="http://dunit.sourceforge.net">
					http://dunit.sourceforge.net</a>)
			<li>
				You need to have MSXML 4.1 installed to use the xpMsXml xml provider. You also 
				need MsXml installed to run the Dunit tests (from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml">
					http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml</a>)
			<li>
			Create a SOAP Directory in your Indy directory. This directory is referred to 
			as &lt;indysoap&gt; hereafter
			<li>
				Copy the IndySoap directory structure into &lt;IndySoap&gt; Directory.<br>
			To actually use IndySoap, you only need the files in the root soap directory, 
			but the other files will be useful from time to time
			<li>
			Add &lt;indysoap&gt; to your delphi library path
			<li>
			Review the compiler defines in &lt;indySoap&gt;\IdSoapDefines.inc - you may 
			want to change these&nbsp;to reflect your system and what&nbsp;features you 
			want&nbsp;
			<li>
			[optional but recommended] Compile and run the DUnit tests in 
			&lt;indysoap&gt;\dunit\IdSoapTests.dpr
			<li>
				Open the IdSoapXX.dpk file, then press the install 
  button. 
  <LI>Package Hell. You might have problems getting IndySoap compiling and 
  installing. here's some tips:</LI>
  <OL>
    <LI>Make sure that your Indy package is updated before installing 
    indysoap</LI>
    <LI>Let delphi modify the package dependencies as it sees fit</LI>
    <LI>when compiling design time packages, delphi compiles off the source in 
    the dcp file, not the unit itself. So weird compile errors can be reported 
    in defiance of the actual source. If you are really having problems, delete 
    any existing indy dcu's and dcp's and recompile the indy package from 
    scratch</LI>
   </OL>
</OL>
<P>If you have problems installing IndySoap, please compile and run 
&lt;indysoap&gt;\dunit\IdSoapTests.dpr before reporting the problems to the 
IndySoap team </P>
