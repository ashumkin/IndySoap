		<P>TIdStringList is a stringlist derivative that offers 2 enhancements. The first 
			is that it is plugged into the IndySoap live object tracking system, so that 
			leaking TIdStringList objects will elad to notifications when the program 
			closes.
		</P>
		<P>In addition, if can take ownership of the objects associated with the list. The 
			contructor takes a parameter AOwnsObject : boolean, and there is a property 
			OwnsObjects:boolean which tells the list whether it should free objects 
			associated with list entries when the entry is deleted.</P>
		<P><EM>Warning: Unlike TObjectList, an object will not be freed if the object property 
				is assigned directly</EM></P>
