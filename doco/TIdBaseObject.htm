<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<p>Throughout IndySoap, every object descends from TIdBaseObject.
TIdBaseObject is 			the basis of object tracking and leak detection,
which are used to improve the 			quality of the code.</p>
		
<p>Every TIdBaseObject and descendent is entered into a list of live
objects, so 			that the object can check unequivocally that it is
valid. This is used 			throughout IndySoap in precondition checks</p>
		
<p>You can&nbsp;get the same advantages from TIdBaseObject by
inheriting your own 			objects from it</p>
		
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<pre>class function GetLiveObjectCount: Cardinal; </pre>
		
<p>Return the number of live objects of this type (this count does not
include 			descendent types)</p>
		
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<pre>property SerialNumber: Integer</pre>
		
<p>It's possible that an object is freed and a new object is created in
the same 			memory location, so that it appears to be object. For this
reason, every object 			created get's a unique serial number that
never changes through the lifetime of 			the object. You can use this
to check that the objet hasn't changed (you <strong>must</strong>
			store this outside the object cause if a new object is created, this
will be 			changed)</p>
		
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<pre>procedure AskForBreakPointOnFree;</pre>
		
<p>If this is called, then when the object is freed, a
debugger&nbsp;breakpoint 			will be called. This will be called even
if the object is&nbsp;erroneously 			freed as another object (but not
if it is erroneously freed using freemem or 			similiar)</p>
		
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<pre>function TestValid(AClassType: TClass = NIL): Boolean;</pre>
		
<p>Checks that the object is in the list of current&nbsp;live objects.
If it is, 			checks that&nbsp;the class is of type AClassType (or
a&nbsp;descendent 			thereof)&nbsp;<br>
