		<H2>TIdSoapServerTCPIP
		</H2>
		<P>TIdSoapServerTCPIP is the server side implementation of the custom IndySOAP 
			TCPIP proctocol. IndySoap provides a custom TCP/IP protocol for use with SOAP 
			request/response. The major advantage of this protocol is that a connection is 
			held open, and the protocol is extremely light weight. This makes this protocol 
			suitable for use in a LAN environment with tightly bound client/server 
			environment
		</P>
		<P>TIdSoapServerTCPIP is a descendent of TIdTCPServer, and provides all the 
			behaviours that of a normal TIdTCPServer.&nbsp;Assing a SoapServer,&nbsp;set 
			the default port to the value you want, and set active to true</P>

		<P>The TIdSoapServer that provides the actual SOAP services. You must assign a
