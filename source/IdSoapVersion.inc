Indy Soap comes to life again!

This version of IndySoap
- compiles and passes all tests under Delphi XE3 and Delphi 5
   - other versions have not been tested
- fixes many bugs due to test coverage being improved
- has a few bugs that were fixed over a 10 year period of using IndySoap

 MAJOR RELEASE

 Many things have been fixed or overhauled.
 highlights:
   * much improved performance
      - loops have been trimmed and optimised
      - custom XML pasrser introduced

   * support for
      - headers
      - polymorphism
      - sets
      - default values on properties
      - compression (if you have zlib.pas and set the ID_SOAP_COMPRESSION define)
      - username and password on WinInet client
      - ergo, MapPoint is now supported

   * Bugs fixed
      - worked around an problem with cookies in some versions of Indy9
      - manual properties are registered with all descendent classes now
      - fixed several character set issues

 Specific changes that may raise backward compatibility issues:
  * ITI wide renaming (no longer constrained to interfaces or methods, you can define renaming for types and names at the ITI level)
  * change parameters of array property registration (split first parameter into 2 strings)
  * the way that WSDL services are mapped into pascal interfaces, and
    the names that they get, has been overhauled. The names are quite likely
    to be different - you will either have to fix them or update your source
    (but their functionality won't have changed)

 Other misc changes
  * allow interface implementation factories to be un-registerd, don't provide wsdl for unregistered interfaces (package support)
  * fix various range check failures
